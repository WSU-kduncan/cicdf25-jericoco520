            <h2>Beyond the Bean</h2>
            <p>Your morning coffee is more than a simple beverage—it's the culmination of countless hands, hearts, and hours of meticulous care. Behind every cup lies a journey that most coffee drinkers never see, a story of dedication that begins long before the first harvest.</p>

                <h3>3-5 Years of Patience</h3>
                <p>Coffee farmers nurture their seedlings for up to five years before the first harvest. This is a commitment made without any financial return, requiring faith, patience, and unwavering dedication to the craft.</p>

            <div class="highlight-card">
                <h3>Hand-Selected, Cherry by Cherry</h3>
                <p>Each coffee cherry is individually inspected and picked at peak ripeness. A single picker may select only the perfect cherries from the same tree multiple times over weeks, leaving unripe fruit to mature naturally.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-card">
                <h3>Altitude & Legacy</h3>
                <p>Many coffee farms sit at elevations above 6,000 feet, where the air is thin and the work is demanding. Families have cultivated these mountain plots for generations, passing down knowledge of microclimates, soil conditions, and cultivation techniques.</p>
