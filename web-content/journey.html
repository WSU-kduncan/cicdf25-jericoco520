            <h1>The Journey: Farm to Cup</h1>
            <p>A process measured not in hours, but in years of dedication</p>

                        <h3>The Nursery: Seeds of Tomorrow</h3>
                        <p>Coffee begins as a seed, carefully selected from the healthiest mother plants. Farmers create protected nurseries where seedlings receive individualized attention—shade cloth adjusted daily, watering schedules modified based on weather patterns, soil composition monitored constantly.</p>
                        <p class="hidden-truth"><strong>Hidden Truth:</strong> Farmers often wake at 4 AM to water seedlings before the sun rises, as young coffee plants are extremely sensitive to temperature stress. This daily ritual continues for 6-12 months before transplanting.</p>

                        <div class="step-number">2</div>
                        <h3>Transplanting: The Critical Move</h3>
                        <p>Moving a coffee plant from nursery to field is an art form. Farmers consider slope orientation, wind patterns, proximity to shade trees, and even the position of neighboring plants. A mistake here can cost years of growth.</p>
                        <p class="hidden-truth"><strong>Hidden Truth:</strong> Many farmers plant by the lunar calendar, transplanting during specific moon phases believed to promote stronger root development—a tradition passed down through generations.</p>

                        <div class="step-number">3</div>
                        <h3>The Waiting Years</h3>
                        <p>For 3-5 years, farmers tend their coffee plants without any harvest. They prune, fertilize with organic compost they've created themselves, and protect against pests and diseases. This is pure investment—labor, time, and love with no immediate reward.</p>
                        <p class="hidden-truth"><strong>Hidden Truth:</strong> During this period, many farmers keep handwritten journals tracking each plant's growth, noting which respond best to certain treatments. This knowledge becomes part of the farm's legacy.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="step step-right">

                        <div class="step-number">4</div>
                        <h3>Selective Harvesting</h3>
                        <p>When harvest finally arrives, pickers return to the same trees 5-7 times over several weeks, selecting only cherries at perfect ripeness. A skilled picker can identify readiness by color, touch, and even sound when cherries are gently shaken.</p>
                        <p class="hidden-truth"><strong>Hidden Truth:</strong> Experienced pickers can harvest 200 pounds of cherries in a day—requiring them to inspect and hand-select up to 40,000 individual cherries. Each movement is precise to avoid damaging the tree or unripe fruit.</p>

                        <h3>Processing: The 72-Hour Window</h3>
                        <p>After picking, cherries must be processed within 24 hours to prevent fermentation. Many farmers use water from mountain springs, carefully monitoring pH levels and temperature. They taste-test the water itself, knowing it influences the final cup.</p>
                        <p class="hidden-truth"><strong>Hidden Truth:</strong> During wet processing, farmers often sleep in shifts near the fermentation tanks, checking every few hours. Over-fermentation by even 30 minutes can ruin an entire season's harvest.</p>

                        <h3>Sun Drying: Dance with Weather</h3>
                        <p>Beans are spread on raised beds or patios, where they must be raked and turned every 30-45 minutes to ensure even drying. If rain threatens, the entire crop must be covered within minutes—often requiring the whole family to mobilize.</p>
                        <p class="hidden-truth"><strong>Hidden Truth:</strong> Farmers develop an intimate relationship with weather patterns, often predicting rain hours before it arrives. They read cloud formations, wind directions, and even insect behavior to protect their drying coffee.</p>

                        <h3>Hand Sorting: The Final Selection</h3>
                        <p>Before export, beans are sorted multiple times by hand. Workers examine thousands of beans per hour, removing defects, damaged beans, and foreign objects. Their trained eyes can spot imperfections smaller than a pinhead.</p>
                        <p class="hidden-truth"><strong>Hidden Truth:</strong> Some families gather for sorting sessions that become social events, with stories and songs shared while hands move in practiced rhythm. The fastest sorters can examine 50 beans per minute while maintaining perfect accuracy.</p>

                        <h3>To Your Cup</h3>
                        <p>After roasting and grinding, the coffee that took years to cultivate is ready in moments. But the care continues even here—roasters adjust profiles based on origin, altitude, and processing method, honoring the farmer's work with precision in the final steps.</p>
                        <p class="hidden-truth"><strong>Hidden Truth:</strong> The best roasters maintain relationships with specific farms for decades, adjusting their techniques each year based on that season's growing conditions—a partnership built on mutual respect and shared dedication to quality.</p>
